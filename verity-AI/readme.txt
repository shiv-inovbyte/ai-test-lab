This captures the gist of my AI prediction model app
Concept - A predictive maintenance model for manufacturing equipment.
    - Generate Synthetic Data
    - Engineer features that are useful to the model
    - Train a Model using sckikit-learn (dang this is one heck of a math API I spent a LOT of time on)
    - Simulate AI Enhancements - How a larger LLM could use this trained ML model to provide a conversation response
